        <h1 id="name">Chenyu Zhang</h1>
        <p id="intro">I am an undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University. 
          I was born in Nanjing, China, and I currently live in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
          This portfolio webpage is written during my internship at Google in summer 2020.</p>

      <p>At JHU, my majors are Applied Math, Computer Science, and Cognitive Science. 
        I enjoy all three of my majors and I think they complement each other very well.
        Aside from school, I am part of the Blue Orchid Dance Club, where we practice trational Chineses dances and give performances at various events 
        (which are, sadly, suspended due to COVID-19). 
        I am also a research assistant at the Mind Brain Institute, and a software developer on the Otoglobal Health design team.
