          <p><h2>Hi!<i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></h2>
          My name is <span id="my-name">Chenyu Zhang</span>. I am an undergraduate student at the <span class="text-bold">Johns Hopkins University</span>. 
          I was born in <span class="text-bold">Nanjing, China</span>, and I currently live in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
          This portfolio website is written during my internship at Google in summer 2020.
          </p>
          <p>At JHU, my majors are <span class="text-bold">Applied Math, Computer Science, and Cognitive Science</span>. 
          I enjoy all three of my majors and I think they complement each other very well.
          Applied Math gives me the mathematical modeling skills needed for almost any subject. Cognitive Science is where I get to think about the human mind and develop interesting ideas. 
          Then Computer Science allows me to build ideas into reality. 
          If you are familiar, you probably have noticed that those three majors combined points to the field of <span class="text-bold text-red">artificial intelligence</span>. 
          I am interested in <span class="text-bold text-red">natural language processing</span> in particular, a field that builds up on statistical knowledge, programming skills, and cognitive linguistics. 
          Some of the NLP projects that I have done include language modeling, part-of-speech tagging, statistical parsing, etc.
          </p>
          <p>Aside from school, I am part of the Blue Orchid Dance Club, where we practice traditional Chineses dances and give performances at various events (which are, sadly, suspended due to COVID-19). 
          I am also a research assistant at the Mind Brain Institute, and a software developer on the Otoglobal Health design team. 
          </p>
          
          <h3>Life Philosophy</h3>
          <p>I believe that <span class="text-bold">the best future is where you know what is going to happen tomorrow, but not what is going to happen next year</span>. 
          When people talk to me about not knowing what to do with their lives, that is what I say. 
          While I do not make specific long-term plans (and they are not likely going to come true anyway), I like to think about life goals. Those give me the motivation to do what I should. 
          For instance, one of my life goals is to make an impact in the tech industry. And I believe that as long as I live my best life everyday, I will eventually be able to make an impact. 
          </p>

          <ul id="hidden-talents" class="dropdown-content">
            <li>I speak <span style="font-weight:700">four</span> languages--<span style="font-weight:700">English, Mandarin, French, and Japanese</span>, with the latter two at conversational level. Personally, I don't think I have very strong memory, but I somehow managed to do that.</li>
            <li>In my spare time, I enjoy <span style="font-weight:700">video production</span>. Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bqGfhN8wlQ">video</a> that I made for my French project, an extension of the classic anime <span style="font-style:italic">Hetalia: Axis Power</span>.</li>
            <li>I play all sorts of musical instruments a little bit (in short, nothing to be proud of). I've played the piano, the flute (both eastern and western), the ukulele, and the French horn.</li>
